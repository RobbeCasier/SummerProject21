# SummerProject21
A project to get a better knowledge on the Unreal Engine.
## Info
A puzzle game where you have to get a minecart to it's destination.  
In order to do this the player has to move and rotate rails, repair rails, move obstacles.  
Your ability to change season around you can help you in reaching the goal.  
## Implemented
* Tool for easily adding new elements to a custom shaped grid
* Moving and rotating rails (straight, 90deg, cross)
* Moving minecart until no movement is possible.
* Moving rock
* Tree (changes on season, drops items depending on season)
* FX depending on season
## To do
* More puzzle related mechanics
* puzzle to open gate to next part of a level
<!--* buttons triggering season effect on specifique obstacles or making a rail visible.-->

## To improve
* Tree (having more effect on a puzzle) <!--, adding an age that gives a different amount of items and can trigger different event like growing new trees and an age counter of all trees -->
